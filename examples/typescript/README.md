# social-parser-typescript-example

This is example of how to use the `social-parser` library in TypeScript. Project is using Bun (with built-in TypeScript support) instead of Node.js because this is to just show an example of how to use the library rather than configuring Node.js to run with ESM modules and TypeScript.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
