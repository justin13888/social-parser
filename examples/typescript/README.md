# social-parser-typescript-example

This is example of how to use the `social-parser` library in TypeScript. Project is using Bun (with built-in TypeScript support) instead of Node.js because this is to just show an example of how to use the library rather than configuring Node.js to run with ESM modules and TypeScript.

## Running

1. Link `social-parser`:

    ```bash
    cd <path-to-social-parser>
    bun link
    ```

2. Install dependencies: `bun install`
3. Run: `bun run index.ts`
