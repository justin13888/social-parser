# Contributing

Contributions are always welcomed! Start by forking the repository and making a PR when follow. Sharing bugs and making feature requests are also appreciated.

Note: All PRs must pass CI/CD and have the necessary unit tests.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

Install the following prerequisites:

- Rust
- Node.js

Then follow the instructions below for each binding.

### For Rust

The actual source code is located in the `crates/social-parser` directory. See `examples/rust` for examples on how to use the library.

#### Publishing to crates.io

Sett this link <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html>

### For TypeScript Bindings

TypeScript bindings are generated using [Neon](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon). Before starting run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

The relevant commands are:

- Build: `npm run build`
- Debug: `npm run debug`
- Test: `npm run test`
- Cross-compile: `npm run cross`
  - This uses [cross-rs](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to cross-compile for another platform. Use the [`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildtarget) environment variable to select the build target.
- Run new release: `npm run release`
- Dry run: `npm run dryrun`
